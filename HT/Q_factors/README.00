This program [HR.f90] written by my dear colleage Dr. Zifei Chen, takes the output from 
the ORCA software package and calculates the Huang-Rhys factors based on the provided
files. All of the required data can be found in the *.hess file outputs, but this data 
needs to be exported into files as per the requirements below.  

There are a small handful of files required to execuete the program:
1) Initial state geometry [GS_geom.xyz].
2) Final state geometry [ES_geom.xyz].
3) Initial state frequency eigenvectors [GS_eigenvector.dat].
4) Initial state frequency eigenvalues [freq.dat].
Please note that for the eigenfrequencies and eigenvalues to include the the
translational and rotational modes ie. first 6 null modes. 

Next, the source code needs to be edited. The third line in specific. Alter the system
size to that of yours. 

Finally, the source code should be compiled:
##COMILE COMMAND##
ifort -qmkl HR.f90
##################

You can now run the code [a.out].
